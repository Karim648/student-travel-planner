You can find hostels for $15-25/night, enjoy free walking tours, visit Prague Castle (tickets around $15), and explore the beautiful Old Town Square at no cost. Street food like trdeln√≠k is cheap and delicious. I'd budget about $40-50/day including accommodation. For a week-long trip, you'd spend around $350-400, leaving plenty of room in your $1500 budget for flights and other cities!",
